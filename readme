Finished checking --- 7 code warnings

The warning are from the testsymtable and not my code.

What warnings does critTer generate on symtablelist.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the critTer warnings here, and express
your disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then
write "None."

symtablelist.c: line 90: medium priority:
   Do you want to validate 'pvValue' through an assert?

   symtablelist.c: line 130: medium priority:
   Do you want to validate 'pvValue' through an assert?

   symtablelist.c: line 231: medium priority:
   Do you want to validate 'pvExtra' through an assert?

I disagree because pvValue and pvExtra can be null.

disagreements with them? Copy the splint warnings here, and express your
disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then write
