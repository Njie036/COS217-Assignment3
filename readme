What authorized sources of information did you use to complete the
assignment? COPY THE LIST of authorized sources of information given
in the "Policies" web page (also available on armlab in the file
~cos217/AuthorizedSourcesList ) to this section of the readme file,
and edit it as appropriate.

The course's lectures.

The course's precepts.

The course's website.

The course's textbooks and reference manuals.

The emacs gdb page for debugging.

The course's current staff members outside of class time through 
office hours. (Donna)

The course's current staff members outside of class time through 
meetings. (Donna)


------------------------------------------------------------------------
What unauthorized sources of information did you use to complete the
assignment? List any unauthorized sources of information that you used
to complete the assignment, and describe how you used them. The course
"Policies" web page defines unauthorized sources of information, and
any source that you have used but not listed in the authorized sources
should be included here. Please note that using an unauthorized source
may trigger a course penalty, and depending on the nature of the
interaction, may additionally require the interaction being reported
to the Committee on Discipline. Write "None" if you used no
unauthorized sources of information.

None


------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful? Was it fun?

I was told that taking COS226 before COS217 would help me with this 
assignment but I believe hash table was properly taught in both lecture
and precept which helped me implement the assigment without reading or 
looking for ouside resources on the topic. Debugging took hours but was
definitely worth the patience. 



------------------------------------------------------------------------
(optional) What information can you provide about your submission that
will help your grader to grade it in the most favorable light? In
particular, what bugs are in your submission?

N/A


------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does splint generate on symtablelist.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the splint warnings here, and express your
disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then write
"None."

   Do you want to validate 'pvValue' through an assert?

   Do you want to validate 'pvExtra' through an assert?

I disagree because pvValue and pvExtra can be null.
